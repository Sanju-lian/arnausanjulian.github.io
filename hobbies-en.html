	<h1>Hobbies</h1>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong>Gaming</strong> <br>
		I enjoy playing video games in my free time. Some of my favorites are <em>Portal 2</em> and <em>Mirror's Edge</em>. I like games that challenge my problem-solving skills, creativity, and reflexes. Playing these games helps me relax while also thinking strategically and experimenting with new ideas.
		</li>	
		<li>
		<strong>Skating</strong> <br>
		I enjoy skateboarding in my free time. I'm not very skilled yet, but I really enjoy it and it’s a fun way to get around.
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Music</strong> <br>
 		I like all kinds of music, especially rap. Music helps me focus when working or studying, relax after a busy day, and motivates me to get things done.
		</li>
		<li>
		<strong>Content Creation</strong> <br>
 		I already have some videos on my YouTube channel, although it’s a bit inactive at the moment. I plan to make new videos about technology, not just to inform, but to share my opinion in a fun and entertaining way.
